# Carbon-nanotube-by-tersoff-potential
Carbon nanotubes is allotrope of carbon with a cylindrical nanostructure. Here its molecular dynamics is studied
by simulation by construction tersoff potential from scratch. The Tersoff potential is a three-body 
potential function which icludes an angular contribution of the force.

## Getting Started
The file [main.cpp](main.cpp) will do a molecular dynamics simulation of Carbon Nanotube.

## Requirements
* C++ compiler 
* [mol.cpp](mol.cpp) - *For molecules*
* [vec.cpp](vec.cpp) - *For vectors*

## Configuration
* **total** - *Number of atoms in a axially repeated cnt*
* **detaT** - *Time step*
* **stepAvg** - *Average time for showing result*
* **regionZ** - *region of axial length*
* **temperature** - *Temperature of system*

## Built With
* [C++](https://isocpp.org/)
